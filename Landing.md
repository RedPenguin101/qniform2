# Qniform Landing Page

Qniform is the future of accounting systems. 
It allows your accounting department to drastically reduce the time they spend doing repetitive work like creating journal entries, closing the books and running reports, freeing them up for more value adding finance tasks.

It does this by recognizing that the modern organization has specialized software for almost every function, all generating activity that needs to be accounted for. 
Legacy enterprise accounting systems are built on the premise that _people_ will be booking journal entries. 
Systematic integration with the rest of your software environment is often a poorly implemented afterthought. 

Qniform is built from the ground up to directly with your upstream software systems to find out what activity needs accounting for, and using rules that you define, will turn those events into journal entries.

## Features of Qniform
