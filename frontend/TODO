The Spec / Rule system and Front end
  User can enter data in form and (if valid) see journal entries
    DONE Malli Spec for expense event
    DONE User can input Event in form driven by Spec
    DONE If provided data in form is valid spec, will display journal entries
    DONE Tidy up form and table
    DONE Add comment field
    DONE Wrap journal entries in transaction abstraction
  User can select between two rules
    DONE Write second spec


What happens when an event comes in that fails the spec test?
