The Spec / Rule system and Front end
  User can enter data in form and (if valid) see journal entries
    DONE Malli Spec for expense event
    DONE User can input Event in form driven by Spec
    DONE If provided data in form is valid spec, will display journal entries
    DONE Tidy up form and table
    DONE Add comment field
    DONE Wrap journal entries in transaction abstraction
  User can select between two rules
    DONE Write second spec
Sale rule
Loan issuance rule
Better reporting on Spec fails

What happens when an event comes in that fails the spec test?


* The Spec / Rule system, with REPL FE initially, then front end allowing input of events from 'library' of specs, and visibility of xforms (no persistence)
    * Equity Injection (sourced from Entity System)
    * Invoice receipt / payment (sourced from Expense system)
    * Sale (sources from Sales system)
    * Loan issuance (from IBOR/Investing system)
* Back end for Transact API, allowing posting of Events and transformation into transactions. Persistence of JEs
* Front and back end for event rule setup
* Front end for General Ledger / Trial Balance / Journal Entry detail visibility.
